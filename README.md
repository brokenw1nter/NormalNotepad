## Questions and Answers
- Q: Why is this console based?
- A: Why not? It's not very practical but it's something I thought would be interesting.
- Q: Why does this require a login?
- A: It doesn't but makes it more "hacker" themed and keeps your serialized documents from being seen by anyone.
- Q: Can I change the username and password?
- A: Yes you can, security logic is under LogicController.java. Yes it is very basic and not very secure. As it's not meant to be.
